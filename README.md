# Introduction

This dataset contains 264,960 transactions between block 270,000 (2013-11-16 22:09:06 UTC) and block 300,000 (2014-05-10 06:32:34 UTC), labeled by Blockstream.infoâ€™s method of CoinJoin detection and a method of SharedCoin detection. In this period SharedCoin is active.

In order to provide more relevant information, the dataset includes a large number of transactions related to the above 264,960 transactions, but this transactions are not labeled.

There are a total of 116,537,811 transactions in the dataset, all of which are real Bitcoin transactions, but the original TXIDs have been replaced with consecutive integers starting from 0 to 116,537,810.

We have computed 15 features for each transaction and provided the ids of the precursor and successor transactions for these transactions.

| negative_ids.txt | 1.2 MB | 132,480     | IDs of negative cases                            | One ID per line                                    |
| tx_features.txt  | 14 GB  | 116,537,811 | Processed features of transactions               | One JSON List per line, empty line for Coinbase TX |
| tree_forward.txt | 4.6 GB | 116,537,811 | Precursor  of each node IDs                      | One JSON List per line, empty line for Coinbase TX |
| tree_back.txt    | 2.2 GB | 116,537,811 | Successor of each node in IDs                    | One JSON List per line, empty line for Unspent TX  |

There are 116,537,811 transactions in this dataset. The original TXID is removed and a consecutive integer starting from 0 is used as ID.

In `tx_features.txt`, `tree_forward.txt` and `tree_back.txt`, the first line refers to the Transaction of ID 0, the second line refers to the ID 1 ....
